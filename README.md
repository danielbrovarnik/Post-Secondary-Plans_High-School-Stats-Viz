This project visualizes the post-secondary destinations of my high school alumni using Python and interactive maps.

## Files

- [`HS_alum_school_stats.ipynb`](HS_alum_school_stats.ipynb): Jupyter notebook for data processing, analysis, and map generation.
- [`name_and_school_modified.csv`](name_and_school_modified.csv): Data with anonymized names for privacy.
- [`schools_map.html`](schools_map.html): Interactive map of alumni destinations generated by Folium.
- [`index.html`](index.html): Alternative or exported map visualization.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: Alumni data is loaded and anonymized in [`HS_alum_school_stats.ipynb`](HS_alum_school_stats.ipynb).
2. **Analysis**: School counts are calculated and visualized.
3. **Geocoding**: School locations are determined using manual coordinates and geopy.
4. **Mapping**: An interactive map is created with Folium, showing each school and alumni count.
5. **Output**: The map is saved as [`schools_map.html`](schools_map.html) for sharing or viewing in a browser.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- folium
- geopy

## Usage

1. Open [`HS_alum_school_stats.ipynb`](HS_alum_school_stats.ipynb) in Jupyter.
2. If you have your own CSV file with columns `Name` and `School`, replace `name_and_school.csv` with your file.
3. Run all cells to process your data and generate the map.
4. Open [`schools_map.html`](schools_map.html) in your browser to view the interactive map.

*Note: Your CSV must have columns named `Name` and `School` for the notebook to work correctly. You can also comment out the anonymizer in the notebook *

## Limitations

- **School Names May Not Be Unique:** Some institutions have multiple campuses or locations (e.g., Culinary Institute of America in Texas and New York). The data and map may not distinguish between these, and geocoding may place markers at only one location.
- **Geocoding Accuracy:** Automated geocoding may not always find the correct campus, especially for schools with similar names or multiple branches.

- ## What I Learned

- Gained experience with pandas for reading, modifying, and exporting CSV data.
- Practiced creating bar charts and visualizing data distributions with matplotlib.
- Got an introduction to geospatial plotting using Folium and geopy.
- Learned how to geocode school names and display them on an interactive map.
- Discovered challenges with mapping ambiguous or duplicate institution names.
- Understood the importance of data privacy and anonymization.
